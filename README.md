# Speech Command Classification and Fine-Tuning
This repository hosts the code and documentation for a speech command classification system using Google's Speech Commands dataset. The project encompasses dataset analysis, model training, performance evaluation, and fine-tuning with custom voice samples to improve keyword recognition accuracy.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a robust classifier capable of recognizing predefined speech commands from the Speech Commands dataset, using deep learning techniques. This system is designed not only to accurately classify standard commands but also to adapt to custom voice samples through model fine-tuning.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Analysis:** Investigate and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the audio samples.
- **Model Training:** Employ deep learning models to classify audio into speech commands.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measure the accuracy and efficiency of the model using various metrics.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Enhance the model's responsiveness to custom voice commands by fine-tuning on a smaller set of personalized samples.
